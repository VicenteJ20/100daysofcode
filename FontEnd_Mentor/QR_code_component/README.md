## My process

1) I created a "Main" tag where I added an internal "div" with a class called "myCard".

2) Inside "myCard" I added all the elements.

3) I used relative units to give responsive design, you can see the code in the files of this repository.

4) I made a "div" to host the corresponding attribution and I took it out of the document flow with the properties "position: fixed; bottom: 1rem;", this way the attribution will always be at the bottom of the page.
