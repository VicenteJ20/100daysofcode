# Overview

I made this calculator with ReactJS, Bootstrap and some custom CSS. it also has 3 themes to choose from:

- 1. standard, a bit dark but not dark enough to be a dark theme.

- 2. Light, all colors are strong and clear.

- 3. Dark. Mostly dark colors, using combinations of purple, yellow and cyan.
